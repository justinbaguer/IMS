# IMS


1. We created a library inventory management system that allows users to view available books. The user information is saved in the program in the form of objects. They can view available books from the genre search criteria (Either fiction or non-fiction). From there, the user can select from which library they wish to select books from. After they input the library of their choice, available copies of the books displayed earlier will appear. We also have an interface class, however, after struggling with it for some time, we could not make it work. We believe it doesn't work because we didn't know how to fit it in with our project proposal, or with any of our classes. 

2. Features:
	Login prompt requesting a username and password.
	Prompt asking user to select a genre (fiction or non-fiction).
	List of books. Each book is listed by title, author, and genre.
	Prompt asking user to choose which library to view available copies of books from.
